## Conference Talk Ideas

### The Internationalization Talk

I was recently asked to build an internationalized/ localized app for a client. Not only did the content of the site need to be in multiple languages, the user-supplied info also needed to be stored in the database in multiple languages. I discovered a few gems and techniques that helped me solve some of the problems I encountered while building this app. The story of this journey (and some of the pitfalls I encountered along the way) might be beneficial to other developers, particularly beginners that might not have ever used i18n or built an app in more than one language.
