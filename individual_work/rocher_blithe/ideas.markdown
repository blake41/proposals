## Conference Talk Ideas

### The Internationalization Talk

I was recently asked to build an internationalized/ localized app for a client. Not only did the content of the site need to be in multiple languages, the user-supplied info also needed to be stored in the database in multiple languages. I discovered a few gems and techniques that helped me solve some of the problems I encountered while building this app. The story of this journey (and some of the pitfalls I encountered along the way) might be beneficial to other developers, particularly beginners that might not have ever used i18n or built an app in more than one language.

#### Feedback

* JC: I gave an Internationalization talk a few years ago. I felt that it was a solid talk, but i18n is hard to make interesting. I18n is one of those things people know they'll need to do one day, but few actually do it. How can you put an "edge" on it? How do you make people care?

* KO: Jeff's talk can be seen here: [Internationalization and Localization](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/1136-scrc2012-internationalization-and-localization)

* KO: There are two other I18n talks that I really like too, which could give you ideas for things that can give it an edge: [Linguistic Potluck](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/1110-gogaruco2012-linguistic-potluck-crowdsourcing-localization-in-rails) by Heather Rivers and [Cultured Localization: How not to offend 1 billion people](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2111-arrrrcamp2012-cultured-localisation-or-how-not-to-offend-1-billion-people) by Ryan Stenhouse.
