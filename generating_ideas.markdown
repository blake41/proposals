### Thinking Questions

* What's something that you've had to do in your job/learning where you felt "out on your own", without much documentation? Or something where the existing documentation/examples didn't make sense?
* What's something you're curious about? Are you intrigued by the underpinnings of language implementations? How CSS is rendered by the browser?
* How does your background and non-programming knowledge/experience influence you / your code? Could that be useful to others?
* Is there a question/topic that you could research (by evaluating code, conducting surveys, etc) and share findings on?
* What are you better at now than you were a year ago? What helped you make that transition?
